# LOCATION BEACONS
# - Droids that react to a location beacon will not sleep for 6 hours

# - Droids will therefore have different reactions for some areas depending on their faction
# - Third element in each tuple is cooldown timer, multiply by 5 to get cooldown in seconds
# - Droids have a minimum cooldown of 60 seconds between location beacon reactions, 0xFF may be an override
# - Locations mapped: https://galaxysedgetech.epizy.com
